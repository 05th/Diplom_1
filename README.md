## Task 1: Unit tests
* Imagine: you need to test a program that helps you order a burger at Stellar Burgers. 
* You have to cover it with unit tests.
* Mocks, stubs and parametrization come in handy here: where exactly to use them, decide for yourself.

### What should be done
* Clone the code snippet repository.
* Connect libraries: Jacoco, Mockito, JUnit 4.
* Cover the Bun, Burger, Ingredient, IngredientType classes with tests. Use mocks, stubs and parametrization where needed.
* The percentage of coverage must be at least 70%.
